'''
Write sample images to disk.

As the robot will sometimes sit on the field for up to 20 minutes before
the match starts we need to be careful how many images we keep.

We are currently saving one image per second.

Hence we write files of the format saved.0/capture_goal_%d.png where
%d is a number from 0 to 300, will give us five minutes before it
starts overwriting the first images.

This way we only keep the last five minutes of images, so we shouldn't
loose anything if we get to the robot within two minutes of the match
finishing and turn it off.

Then to prevent the next boot up from overwriting them again, on
startup we move the "saved.0" directory to saved.1, but before we do
that we move saved.1 to saved.2 and so on for 5 directories.

This way we can wait for four starts before losing images. Ideally
we would copy images off after every match.

Even better would be to write them to a USB key, but this didn't happen
in time for Sydney
