hamcrest-all-1.3.jar
jcommon-1.0.23.jar

junit-4.12.jar
libCTRE_PhoenixCCI.so
libpathfinderjava.so
navx_frc.jar
Pathfinder-Java-1.8.jar
Pathfinder-Java-sources.jar

They are uploaded the repo so that the jar/so files are under version control
and it's hard to push an old version to the robot just because an old laptop
was used.
